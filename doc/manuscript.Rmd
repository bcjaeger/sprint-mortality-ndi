# ABSTRACT

__Background__. Both the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and the Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) trial have shown benefits of intensive blood pressure control on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, as both trials were ended after slightly more than 3 years of follow-up, the legacy effect of intensive treatment on longer term cardiovascular and all-cause mortality is unknown. 

__Methods__. We linked participants in SPRINT to the National Death Index (NDI, 2016 to 2020), assessing cardiovascular mortality using the NDI plus system. Cox and competing risk regression models were used to model the effect of intensive treatment through the trial and during post-trial follow-up on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality respectively      

```{r}

# ap makes inline insertion of results less text-heavy.
# ap = access point, 
# b = baseline, l = longitudinal
# o = overall, i = intensive, s = standard,
# t = trial, c = cohort

ap_b_o <- inline$base_ds$overall$overall$overall
ap_b_i <- inline$base_ds$overall$overall$Intensive
ap_b_s <- inline$base_ds$overall$overall$Standard

ap_l_o_t <- inline$long_inf$overall$overall$trial
ap_l_o_c <- inline$long_inf$overall$overall$cohort

# make the . symbol equivalent to calling table_glue.
# Another way to makes inline insertion of results less text-heavy
. <- table.glue::table_glue

```


__Results__. Over a median follow-up of `r ap_b_o$fup_est` years, there were `r ap_b_i$n_cvd` and `r ap_b_i$n_acm` cardiovascular and all-cause deaths with intensive treatment respectively, and `r ap_b_s$n_cvd` cardiovascular / `r ap_b_s$n_acm` all-cause deaths for standard treatment. Intensive treatment was beneficial for both cardiovascular (Hazard Ratio [HR] = `r with(ap_l_o_t, .("{cvd_est}, 95% CI {cvd_lwr} to {cvd_upr}"))`) and all-cause mortality (HR = `r with(ap_l_o_t, .("{mort_est}, 95% CI {mort_lwr} to {mort_upr}"))`) through close-out visits for the trial (follow-up through July 2016). However, there was no indication of benefit during post-trial follow-up for either cardiovascular (HR = `r with(ap_l_o_c, .("{cvd_est}, 95% CI {cvd_lwr} to {cvd_upr}"))`) or all-cause mortality (HR = `r with(ap_l_o_c, .("{mort_est}, 95% CI {mort_lwr} to {mort_upr}"))`). Results were similar for subgroups based on baseline age, cognitive function, and frailty status. 

__Conclusions__. Our results show a clear benefit for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality during the trial which was largely attenuated during post-trial observational follow-up. Given indications of increasing blood pressures in SPRINT participants randomized to intensive treatment following the trial, these results highlight the importance of consistent long-term management of hypertension in line with current guidelines.

# SUPPLEMENT

We have a total of `r nrow(base_viz_inc)`) plots showing all-cause mortality and mortality split into cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes. They are automated enough to dynamically set text and axis values that will look reasonable. To show what I mean, I've added the figures for adults 75 years or older, who have a much higher incidence.
